# P1-BMI-

My application calculates Body Mass Index of a person.
First it takes height and weight of a person based on the input values it calculates the  Body mass Index value.Depending upon body mass Index value we will tell them whether they are Underweight,Normal,Overweight,obese.And people who are underweight,  Overweight, Obese we will ask them  whether they want to buy product or not in order to fit.If they want to buy product they will click yes and ask them how many quantities they want based on the no of quantities we will tell them cost of the Product.If they don't want to buy they will click 'q'(quit) to exit from the app.
